Planning on notion: https://www.notion.so/project-fifa/invite/400bef7e93f1f2a85b6c672b54e36f5927d361b9

## Background
We are hired by a new club owner to determine which players they should recruite in order to win the next tournament. For this, we decided on ranking players by their market value.

We will also be creating a model to predict market values based on a number of variables with the assumption that the higher the market value, the stronger the performance of a player is.

We will be doing weekly reports about the progress of our findings and progress.
